<p><strong>Device #:</strong> RA-004</p>
<p><strong>Device type:</strong> Mobile Platform</p>
<p><strong>Name:</strong> Flone 3.0</p>
<p><strong>License:</strong> <a href="https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/4.0/deed.en">CC-BY-SA</a></p>
<p><strong>Build Complexity:</strong> RA-004 requires a laser cutter, plywood glue, a computer, a soldering iron, and a phone.
A 3D printer may be used instead of a laser cutter but that would take additional effort.
As most components are built with machines, there is little fine detail work.</p>
<p>RA-004 is a simple project designed with beginers in mind and it isn&rsquo;t expected to take very long to build.
The BoM is approximately 150USD (2016).
It is important to note that RA-004 is 9 years old as of writing, thus it is fully expected that many components are no longer available or have changed.
This adds a significant level of difficulty, although it can also be considered a learning opportunity for electronic control systems.</p>
<p><strong>Description:</strong> RA-004 is a small aproximately 20cm by 20cm camera drone, which is primarily made from plywood.
The design does not contain a camera, but rather it has a mount so a phone with the camera facing down can be attached to it.
RA-004 is easily modifiable.
Example modifications have been created, they are: a gimbaled camera, a seed drop-release system, and a spray paint addon.</p>
<p>RA-004 was well received online when it was created by aeracoop in 2016.</p>
