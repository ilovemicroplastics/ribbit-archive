<p><strong>Device #:</strong> RA-003</p>
<p><strong>Device type:</strong> Mobile Platform</p>

<p><strong>Build Complexity:</strong> RA-003 requires a large laser cutter, a 3D printer, a soldering iron, a voltmeter, and a screwdriver.
The difficulty in constructing RA-003 is mostly in finding a large enough laser cutter, as despite it&rsquo;s large size RA-003 is remarkably simple to manufacture.
It is advisable to have electronics skills to safely assemble the circuits, as well as workshop skills to cut plywood components and 3D print the release mechanism.</p>
<p>Because almost every component is created in a machine, there is very little fine detailing work.
Most of the time building RA-003 comes from preparing the components.
The BoM comes out to less than 3000EUR (2025) which is considered low cost when compared to devices of the same class.</p>
<p><strong>Description:</strong> RA-003 is an approximately 1.5m by 1.5m plywood drone, with a primary purpose of ecological restoration via aerial seed sowing.
In it&rsquo;s base form it is well suited for both forestry and agriculture.
It is capable of flying for 41 minutes without a payload, and can store up to 10kg of seeds.
This is further mediated by autopilot software capable of sowing one hectare in 10 minutes, with a seed density of about 5 per square meter.
The design is aesthetically pleasing and minimal, while using zip-ties through laser cut channels to hold the frame together.</p>
<p>There is an intricate 3D printed seed deployment mechanism which allows the use of any standard screw-cap plastic bottle as a seed storage,
and an opening which can be varied to set sowing rate.
Plywood was historically used as a material for planes, and was selected for this project both for it&rsquo;s low weight and biodegradeability in case of crashing irecoverably.
As an added benefit, plywood is easy to mend with glue which increases the long-term usability.</p>
<p>RA-003 is well received online but it&rsquo;s difficult to quanitify how widespread it is in practice.
Owing to it&rsquo;s open licensing terms, it is trivial to repurpose the frame for tasks other than sowing seeds.
It was created by Dronecoria in their laboratory based in Capilerilla (Spain), Sierra Nevada Natural Park in 2025.</p>
